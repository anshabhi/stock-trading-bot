This repository talks about a small side project of mine where I built an automated trading bot.
I primarily used 2 ways to build the trading bot:

1. [Using History Data](history)
2. [Using Technical Analysis](technical-analysis)

As a preliminary conclusion, I was able to make profitable trades on a consistent basis using technical analysis while history data consistently gave wrong signals for the future.
